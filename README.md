# Js Tip Calculator
Welcome to my Js Tip Calculator Repo! The purpose of this project is to learn how to create a tip calculator that accounts for the bill total, excellence of service and separates the tip by how many people are sharing the bill. This is a great exercise as it solves a very real-world problem. People struggle to agree on how well a server should be tipped at a restaurant. 

## Objectives
- Incorporate the state of input
- Factor in dynamic values to return a strategically calculated tip
